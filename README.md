These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above.[Elk Playbook](https://github.com/gman223/gman223-UofT-Cybersec-Project1/blob/main/Files/elk-playbook.yml) Alternatively, select portions of the [Filebeat Playbook](https://github.com/gman223/gman223-UofT-Cybersec-Project1/blob/main/Files/filebeat-playbook.yml) may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.
